# Harvest Support and Getting Help

Welcome to Harvest! Harvest is an officially supported NetApp project. That means you can reach out
to NetApp using any of the [standard mechanisms](http://mysupport.netapp.com/info/web/ECMLP2619434.html) and get the enterprise grade
support you need.

This document describes Harvest's release and support lifecycle as well as places you can get help.

## Harvest's Release and Support Lifecycle

Harvest releases quarterly in January, April, July, and October. 

Each release of Harvest supports the most recently released version of ONTAP. We make a best effort to also ensure that earlier versions of ONTAP are supported. When that's not possible, breaking changes will be outlined in the changelog.

Harvest is constantly being improved with new features and bug fixes and customers are encouraged to upgrade frequently to take advantage of those improvements.

`Each Harvest release is supported for 12 months.`

When `YY.MM` (ex: 19.04) is released, it is fully supported until `YY+1.MM` (ex: 20.04) is released. At the same time, `YY-1.MM` (ex: 18.04) and associated minor releases (ex: 18.04.1) move to limited support.

If you are running a version of Harvest thatâ€™s more than 12 months old, you must upgrade to a newer version to receive full support from NetApp. We always recommend running the latest version.

We use GitHub for tracking bugs and feature requests.
