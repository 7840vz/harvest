# Harvest’s Release and Support Lifecycle

This document helps Harvest deployers understand its release and support lifecycle in order to better plan deployments and encourage timely upgrades that include the latest functionality and fixes.

Harvest releases quarterly in January, April, July, and October. Each release of Harvest supports the most recently released versions of ONTAP. In addition, Harvest is constantly being improved with new features and bug fixes. Customers are encouraged to upgrade frequently to take advantage of these improvements.

## Harvest's Support and Upgrade Policies

`Each Harvest release is supported for 12 months.`

When `YY.MM` (ex: 19.04) is released, it is fully supported until `YY+1.MM` (ex: 20.04) is released. At the same time, `YY-1.MM` (ex: 18.04) and associated minor releases (ex: 18.04.1) move to limited support.

If you are running a version of Harvest that’s more than 12 months old, you must upgrade to a newer version to receive full support from NetApp. We always recommend running the latest supported version of Harvest.
